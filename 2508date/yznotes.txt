## Bit Flip Analysis Results - Padding Comparison

### Zero Padding Results (Previous)
Configuration settings with zero padding for request/response messages.

| Configuration | Float Flips | Fixed Flips | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Baseline (case1) | ~25M-26M | ~7M-7.5M | Estimated from previous runs |
| Case3 IEEE754 | ~22M-23M | ~6.5M-7M | Affiliated ordering with IEEE754 sorting |
| Case3+Fixed | ~22M-23M | ~6M-6.5M | Affiliated ordering with fixed-point sorting |
| Case4 Separated | ~19M-20M | ~6M-6.5M | Separated ordering with IEEE754 sorting |
| Case4+Fixed | ~19M-20M | ~5M-5.5M | Separated ordering with fixed-point sorting |

### Random Padding Results (Current - 8x8 NoC)
Configuration settings with random padding for request/response messages.

| Configuration | Float Flips | Fixed Flips | Reduction vs Baseline |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Baseline (case1) | 33,121,441 | 9,418,050 | - |
| Case3 IEEE754 | 30,192,331 | 8,946,479 | 8.8% float, 5.0% fixed |
| Case3+Fixed | 30,339,017 | 8,402,667 | 8.4% float, 10.8% fixed |
| Case4 Separated | 27,101,521 | 8,258,808 | 18.2% float, 12.3% fixed |
| Case4+Fixed | 27,531,238 | 7,227,170 | 16.9% float, 23.3% fixed |

### LLM Mode Debug Results (4x4 NoC)
Testing LLM attention mechanism with different ordering strategies:

| Configuration | Bit Flips | Notes |
|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Affiliated (case3) | 4,134 | Query follows Key's bit-count order |
| Separated (case4) | 4,211 | Query and Key sorted independently |

**Key Findings:**
- Affiliated ordering performs slightly better than separated (77 fewer bit flips)
- This contradicts initial theoretical expectations
- Analysis revealed that separated mode was missing matrix reshaping logic
- Fixed LLM implementation to match CNN's matrix reshaping exactly
- Both modes now work correctly with proper bit-count sorting

### Analysis Summary

1. **Padding Impact**: 
   - Random padding increases bit flips by approximately 26-34% compared to zero padding
   - This is expected as random values have more bit transitions than zeros

2. **Optimization Effectiveness**:
   - All sorting strategies remain effective even with random padding
   - Relative improvements between configurations are maintained

3. **Best Configurations**:
   - Case4 (separated ordering) shows best float optimization in CNN mode
   - Case4+Fixed shows best fixed-point optimization
   - Fixed-point sorting provides additional benefits for fixed-point metrics
   - In LLM mode: Affiliated slightly outperforms separated

4. **Robustness**:
   - Bit-flip reduction techniques work consistently across different padding strategies
   - Demonstrates real-world applicability beyond zero-padding scenarios

### Technical Notes

- IEEE754 vs Fixed-point sorting: Fixed-point sorting optimizes based on Q1.7 format bit representation
- Affiliated vs Separated ordering: Results vary by mode (CNN vs LLM)
- Test environment: Various NoC configurations (4x4 for LLM, 8x8 for CNN)
- LLM separated mode was fixed to include proper matrix reshaping logic

### CNN Network Results with Zero Padding (2025-09-05)

Network Configuration:
- Model: newnet2 (NOT LeNet)
- Network size: 8x8 NoC  
- Data: Random weights and inputs from randomeval mode
- Padding: Zero padding for message payloads (default, NOT PADDING_RANDOM)
- Layers: Conv2D -> Pool -> Conv2D -> Pool -> FC(120) -> FC(84) -> FC(10)

Bit Flip Reduction Results (with zero padding):

| Configuration | Float Bit Flips | Fixed Bit Flips | Float Reduction | Fixed Reduction |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Case1 (Baseline) | 26,270,808 | 7,269,656 | - | - |
| Case3 (Affiliated) | 23,341,606 | 6,798,263 | 11.2% | 6.5% |
| Case4 (Separated) | 20,250,888 | 6,110,414 | 22.9% | 15.9% |

Key Findings:
- Separated ordering (分离排序)效果最好，浮点减少22.9%，定点减少15.9%
- Affiliated ordering (关联排序)效果中等，浮点减少11.2%，定点减少6.5%
- CNN实际网络的优化效果比小规模随机数据测试(6-7%)显著更好

### CNN Network Results with Random Padding (2025-09-05)

Same network configuration but with PADDING_RANDOM enabled:

| Configuration | Float Bit Flips | Fixed Bit Flips | Float Reduction | Fixed Reduction |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Case1 (Baseline) | 33,121,441 | 9,418,050 | - | - |
| Case3 (Affiliated) | 30,193,085 | 8,947,817 | 8.8% | 5.0% |
| Case4 (Separated) | 27,101,521 | 8,258,808 | 18.2% | 12.3% |

Padding Comparison:
- Zero padding baseline: 26,270,808 float flips
- Random padding baseline: 33,121,441 float flips (26% increase)
- Zero padding Case4: 20,250,888 (22.9% reduction)
- Random padding Case4: 27,101,521 (18.2% reduction)

Conclusion: Random padding increases overall bit flips but sorting optimizations remain effective
